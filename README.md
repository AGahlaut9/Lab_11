## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
Edge-sensitive circuits respond only to changes, rising and falling, of a clock signal, while level-sensitive circuits respond whenever the clock is at a certain level, such as high or low

### Why is it important to declare initial state?
Declaring the initial state makes sure that the circuit starts in a known condition and prevents unpredictable behavior

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
Edge-sensitive circuits let us build synchronous memory elements like flip-flops, counters, and registers that change state only at clock edges
